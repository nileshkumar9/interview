/**
 * @author Nilesh Kumar
 *
 * Problem Description
 *
 * Rishabh has given you a linked list in the form of its head node A. He has also given you an integer B.
 *
 * You need to change the value of each node to its nearest multiple of B that is <= current value.
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= size of list <= 105
 *
 * 1 <= value of each node <= 105
 *
 * 1 <= B <= 105
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 * First argument is the head pointer of linked list A.
 *
 * Second argument is the integer B.
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format
 * Return the head of the changed linked list.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  A = 1 -> 2 -> 3
 *  B = 2
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  A = 3 -> 4 -> 5
 *  B = 3
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  0 -> 2 -> 2
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  3 -> 3 -> 3
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  All numbers have been replaced by nearest multiples of 2.
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  All numbers have been replaced by nearest multiples of 3.
